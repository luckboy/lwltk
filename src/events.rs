//! A module of events.
//!
//! The module of events contains enumerations of events and related enumerations to events. This
//! module has two event enumerations. The first event enumeration has events which are pushed to
//! an event queue expect one variant. The second event enumeration has events which directly called
//! in a Wayland event or a system event. The first event enumeration is an [`Event`] enumeration
//! and has a variant that has a client event. The second event enumeration is a [`ClientEvent`]
//! enumeration.
